<h1>Installation</h1>

<h2>Windows</h2>

You can get installers or portable builds from the [releases section](https://github.com/fn2006/PollyMC/releases/latest), MSVC builds are recommended over MinGW builds but there's no real difference.

<h3>Scoop Installer</h3>

If you prefer Scoop over traditional methods of installing Windows programs, [TechPro424](https://github.com/TechPro424) maintains a Scoop bucket that provides PollyMC.

To install PollyMC from Scoop:

First run `scoop bucket add TechPro424 https://github.com/TechPro424/scoop-bucket` to add the bucket to your system.

Then run `scoop install TechPro424/pollymc`.

<h2>Linux</h2>

You can get the launcher as an AppImage, a Flatpak or a portable binary from the [releases section](https://github.com/fn2006/PollyMC/releases/latest).

Alternatively, PollyMC is also available on the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages?O=0&K=pollymc).

<h2>MacOS</h2>

There are builds for MacOS in the [releases section](https://github.com/fn2006/PollyMC/releases/latest).
<h2></h2>

To build the launcher yourself, follow [the instructions on the Prism Launcher website](https://prismlauncher.org/wiki/development/build-instructions) but clone this repo instead.
