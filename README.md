PolyMC 5
=========

PolyMC is a custom launcher for Minecraft that focuses on predictability, long term stability and simplicity.

This is a **fork** of the MultiMC Launcher and not endorsed by MultiMC. The PolyMC community felt that the maintainer was not acting in the spirit of Free Software so this fork was made. Read "[Why was this fork made?](https://github.com/PolyMC/PolyMC/wiki/FAQ)" on the wiki for more details.

## Packages
We currently don't have any packages available yet as this project has just been started, but we expect this to change very soon.

### Building
If you want to build PolyMC yourself, check [BUILD.md](BUILD.md) for build instructions.

### Code formatting
Just follow the existing formatting.

In general, in order of importance:
* Make sure your IDE is not messing up line endings or whitespace and avoid using linters.
* Prefer readability over dogma.
* Keep to the existing formatting.
* Indent with 4 space unless it's in a submodule.
* Keep lists (of arguments, parameters, initializers...) as lists, not paragraphs. It should either read from top to bottom, or left to right. Not both.
