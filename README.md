PolyMC is a custom launcher for Minecraft that focuses on predictability, long term stability and simplicity.

This is a **fork** of the MultiMC Launcher and not endorsed by MultiMC. The PolyMC community felt that the maintainer was not acting in the spirit of Free Software so this fork was made.

[Windows (32-bit)](https://packages.polymc.org/latest/win32/win32.zip) ([SHA256](https://packages.polymc.org/latest/win32/win32.zip.sha256)) - this is a portable package, you can extract it anywhere and run it. This package needs testing.

## <img src="https://www.vectorlogo.zone/logos/apple/apple-tile.svg" height="20" /> MacOS

MacOS currently does not have any packages. We are still working on setting up MacOS packaging. Meanwhile, you can [build](https://github.com/PolyMC/PolyMC/blob/develop/BUILD.md#macos) it for yourself.

## Development Builds

There are per-commit development builds available [here](https://github.com/PolyMC/PolyMC/actions). These have debug information in the binaries, so their file sizes are relatively larger.
Builds are provided for Linux, AppImage on Linux, Windows, and macOS.

# Help & Support

Feel free to create an issue if you need help. However, you might find it easier to ask in the Discord server.

[![PolyMC Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/923671181020766230?label=PolyMC%20Discord)](https://discord.gg/xq7fxrgtMP)

For people who don't want to use Discord, we have a Matrix Space which is bridged to the Discord server:

[![PolyMC Space](https://img.shields.io/matrix/polymc:polymc.org?label=PolyMC%20Space&server_fqdn=matrix.polymc.org)](https://matrix.to/#/#polymc:polymc.org)

If there are any issues with the space or you are using a client that does not support the feature here are the individual rooms:

# Development

If you want to contribute to PolyMC you might find it useful to join our Discord Server or Matrix Space.

## Building

If you want to build PolyMC yourself, check [BUILD.md](BUILD.md) for build instructions.

## Code formatting
Just follow the existing formatting.

In general, in order of importance:

- Make sure your IDE is not messing up line endings or whitespace and avoid using linters.
- Prefer readability over dogma.
- Keep to the existing formatting.
- Indent with 4 space unless it's in a submodule.
- Keep lists (of arguments, parameters, initializers...) as lists, not paragraphs. It should either read from top to bottom, or left to right. Not both.

## Translations

The translation effort for PolyMC is hosted on [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/polymc/polymc/) and information about translating PolyMC is available at https://github.com/PolyMC/Translations
